I am a Senior Cryptography Engineer at [Polymath](http://polymath.network/).
Previously, I was a Team Lead at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_ca/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html).

I have received my PhD in Computer Science from [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/icis/) on
[Design and Implementation of Maliciously Secure Two-Party Computation](https://prism.ucalgary.ca/handle/11023/3899).

I deeply care about security and software engineering, in particular how to create novel and practical software
solutions and protect the privacy of the user without asking them to put a huge amount of trust on third party companies.

The contents of this blog are my personal opinions and does not necessarily reflect the opinions of my employers.
Moreover, as learn more and evolve, my opinions and world views changes evolve (hopefully for the better).
